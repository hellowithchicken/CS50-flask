Hi! Welcome to WeekYou - the only weekly planner that you will ever need.

**Technologies used**:
* Flask
* Jinja
* sqlite

The idea here is simple - **all of us have different roles in our lives**, we just may not realise it. WeekYou helps you unlock your full potential.

## 1. Set Roles

When you first register you have to create roles for your profile and set a long-term goal - you can do that by clicking on 'Roles' in the top bar.

For example:
* Student - achieve over 70% this semester
* Father - make more time for my children.

## 2. Set weekly goals

Once you have created roles and long-term goals, you must set weekly goals for each role. This will help you make your life more structured and help you achieve your long-term goals easier. Do that under the 'This week' section.

For example:
* Student - study 2h after my lectures for module CS50.
* Father - plan a day out with my family this saturday (maybe a cinema?).

## 3. Achieve

Make sure to mark down any goals you have achieved throughout the week in the 'This week' section - this will help you stay motivated by improving your statistics under the 'Track' section.  Don't forget - any goals not set as completed will be mark as unsuccessful after the week ends.
